I am a biomolecular archaeologist and bioinformatician carrying out [my Ph.D.](http://www.shh.mpg.de/employees/45083/25522) on [ancient oral microbiomes](http://www.shh.mpg.de/348251/Evolution-and-Ecology-of-the-Human-Oral-Microbiome) in the [Department of Archaeogenetics](http://www.shh.mpg.de/28671/research_outline) at the [Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History](http://www.shh.mpg.de/en).

I originally trained as an Archaeologist at the University of York, where I specialised in palaeoproteomics. After which I moved to the Universität Tübingen to study for an M.Sc. in Archaeological Sciences, specialising in the palaeogenetics. During my time in Tübingen I also worked as a technician for a stable isotope lab.

My current area of research is centered on the ancient DNA content of fossilised dental plaque, also known as dental calculus. My sample set includes individuals spanning from the Palaeolithic to modern day. I am primarily exploring how we can analyse and [authenticate](http://www.jafy.eu/publication/2017-04-17-robust-framework-microbial-archaeology) the complex genetic makeup of this material through shotgun metagenomics.

I am also involved in the leading and developing of the open-source nexflow pipeline [nf-core/eager (v2)](https://github.com/nf-core/eager), which is intended to be a complete re-write and extension of the NGS processing pipeline for ancient DNA data [EAGER (v1)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0918-z), to reach modern computational and palaeogenetic standards. I am developing and contributing to multiple open-source software focusing on ancient metagenomics (which can be seen on my [github](https://www.github.com/jfy133/)). I also established an [international community of researchers in ancient metagenomics](https://spaam-community.github.io), and ran the associated [SPAAM2 round-table workshop](https://spaam-community.github.io/#/spaam2/README).

Previously, I have worked on [Late Pleistocene woolly mammoth mitochondrial genomes](http://www.jafy.eu/publication/2017-12-18-central-european-woolly-mammoth), as well as testing [collagen 'fingerprinting' methods (ZooMS) on burnt skeletal remains](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274006074_It_Will_Not_Be_Possible_To_Use_Zooarchaeology_By_Mass_Spectrometry_ZooMS_To_Identify_Species_In_Samples_Of_Cremated_Bone_That_Have_Been_Burnt_Higher_Than_155oC?_iepl%5BviewId%5D=hOoc4o8VsWpiJjo3eXvIspCV&_iepl%5BprofilePublicationItemVariant%5D=default&_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=prfpi&_iepl%5BtargetEntityId%5D=PB%3A274006074&_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationTitle).
