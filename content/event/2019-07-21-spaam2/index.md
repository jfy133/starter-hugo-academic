abstract: "The field of metagenomics is massively expanding our understanding of biological environments. While the increasing sensitivity of modern techniques is enabling the detection of a greater diversity of microbial and eukaryotic taxa at lower abundance, this data-rich discipline comes with many challenges in making sense of these highly dimensional datasets. Ancient metagenomics is no exception, but brings along additional obstacles related to the degraded nature of samples and low sample biomass. Knowledge sharing, distribution, and coordination between archaeo- and palaeogeneticists is crucial to ensure efficiency in overcoming these challenges.

In this context, we propose a second meeting of the Standards, Precautions and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics (SPAAM) workshop that occurred in 2016 (Jena, Germany) to bring together the ancient microbial genetics community to address the issues raised above. We aim to define the highest priority obstacles in ancient metagenomics, share past-experiences in overcoming and mitigating these obstacles, and guide the development of future solutions and standards in this field. Therefore, PhD and postdoc scholars who are actively analysing these datasets are our target demographic. In a round-table discussion format, we will cover four main topics:

1. Biases in ancient metagenomics research
2. Authentication of ancient metagenomics datasets
3. Open and reproducible science
4. Building networks within the ancient metagenomics community

We envision the primary outcome of this workshop to be the establishment of an active, ongoing community for consistent knowledge dissemination and constructive assistance between ancient DNA labs. A major component of this will be creating structured consensus guidelines for optimizing ancient metagenomics wet and dry-lab workflows. In doing so, we aim to keep the field focused and up-to-date in accordance with the advances being made in modern metagenomics research. Secondarily, we aim to write an opinion paper on the status and major challenges of the field that clearly defines standards for these types of studies. These initiatives should help to consolidate ancient metagenomics as a solid research field connecting both archaeology and the biological sciences."

A grassroots-organised (originally) satellite meeting to ISBA9, specialising in tackling the challenges of ancient metagenomics.

I established, co-organised, chaired and also presented at the SPAAM2 round-table discussion workshop. Involving 80 ancient metagenomic researchers from around the world, we discussed a wide range of topics spanning the challenges of ancient microbiome, pathogenomic and environmental DNA reconstruction.

I laso gave a presentation entitled "Towards standards in metadata reporting in ancient metagenomic studies: experiences from AncientMetagenomeDir", co-written with Antonio Fernandez Guerra. More information on SPAAM2 can be found on the [SPAAM community website](https://spaam-community.github.io/#/spaam2/README).
