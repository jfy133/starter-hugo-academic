summary: "Conference Poster"

abstract: "Evolutionary research over the deep time-scales facilitated by ancient DNA requires large comparative datasets spanning wide geographic and temporal ranges. While the field of palaeogenomics has been celebrated for high standards towards making raw data publicly available, finding these data is not always trivial. Much of the necessary metadata used to evaluate the inclusion of public data into ongoing projects are difficult to find, or entirely omitted, in addition to being inconsistently reported and formatted across publications. Thus, data retrieval is often time consuming and tedious.
 
Here we present a community-run collaborative initiative to improve access to publicly available data for a range of ancient metagenomic research fields. AncientMetagenomeDir is a collection of annotated sample lists covering ancient host-associated metagenomes (e.g. microbiomes), host-associated microbial single-genomes (e.g. pathogens) and sedimentary DNA samples. It uses consensus-agreed standardised definitions to summarise essential sample data for palaeogenomics studies as well as sample and study accession IDs. 
 
Additionally, we describe experiences regarding establishing the initiative and compiling the database, to provide an example framework for other potential large-scale and collaborative initiatives within the ancient DNA field. Finally, we will raise the general challenges regarding metadata retrieval for ancient DNA samples found during this project, and initiate discussion on possible solutions on how to address these issues for the entire biomolecular archaeology discipline."

I presented a poster on the AncientMetagenomeDir SPAAM Community project of ancient metagenomic sample metadata aggregation.

I also gave a lightning talk of the poster.
