I gave a lecture to masters and PhD students at the University of Tübingen on the challenges of using ancient DNA to study diet in the past, in particular focusing on our ability to authenticate these signals in dental calculus and palaeofaeces. I also presented a brief set of guidelines aimed at archaeologists, on what to look for when reading an ancient DNA paper in this context. The slides from this talk can found on Google Drive [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zZSo9VqlUDxi4IciFkddg-27Ypk6nKzF-aul8t3IzZI/edit?usp=sharing), made available under a CC-NC-SA 4.0 License.
