title: "Introduction to NGS DNA Sequencing and Processing"

event: "MPI-SHH Summer School: Doorway to Human History"
event_url: https://summerschool.shh.mpg.de/course.html#archaeogenetics

location: Online
address:
  city: Jena
  country: Germany

summary: "Invited Lecture"

abstract: "In this session we will introduce how modern Next-Generation-Sequencing machines convert DNA molecules to human readable files. We will have a live demo on how these sort of files are then computationally processed for downstream genetic analysis using the dedicated ancient DNA pipeline nf-core/eager. Finally, we will have a hands-on activity of how to go through a NGS data processing report."

I introduced the basics of Illumina NGS data generation, and gave a practical walkthrough on how to process and evaluate such data.
