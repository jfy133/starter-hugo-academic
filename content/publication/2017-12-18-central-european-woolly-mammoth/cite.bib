  abstract = "The population dynamics of the Pleistocene woolly mammoth
              (Mammuthus primigenius) has been the subject of intensive
              palaeogenetic research. Although a large number of mitochondrial
              genomes across Eurasia have been reconstructed, the available
              data remains geographically sparse and mostly focused on eastern
              Eurasia. Thus, population dynamics in other regions have not been
              extensively investigated. Here, we use a multi-method approach
              utilising proteomic, stable isotope and genetic techniques to
              identify and generate twenty woolly mammoth mitochondrial
              genomes, and associated dietary stable isotopic data, from highly
              fragmentary Late Pleistocene material from central Europe. We
              begin to address region-specific questions regarding central
              European woolly mammoth populations, highlighting parallels with
              a previous replacement event in eastern Eurasia ten thousand
              years earlier. A high number of shared derived mutations between
              woolly mammoth mitochondrial clades are identified, questioning
              previous phylogenetic analysis and thus emphasizing the need for
              nuclear DNA studies to explicate the increasingly complex genetic
              history of the woolly mammoth.",
