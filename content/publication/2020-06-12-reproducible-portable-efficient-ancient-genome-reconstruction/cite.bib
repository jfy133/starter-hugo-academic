  abstract = "The broadening utilisation of ancient DNA to address
              archaeological, palaeontological, and biological questions is
              resulting in a rising diversity in the size of laboratories and
              scale of analyses being performed. In the context of this
              heterogeneous landscape, we present nf-core/eager, an advanced
              and entirely redesigned and extended version of the EAGER
              pipeline for the analysis of ancient genomic data. This Nextflow
              pipeline aims to address three main themes: accessibility and
              adaptability to different computing configurations,
              reproducibility to ensure robust analytical standards, and
              updating the pipeline to the latest routine ancient genomic
              practises. This new version of EAGER has been developed within
              the nf-core initiative to ensure high-quality software
              development and maintenance support; contributing to a long-term
              lifecycle for the pipeline. nf-core/eager will assist in ensuring
              that ancient DNA sequencing data can be used by a diverse range
              of research groups and fields. \#\#\# Competing Interest
