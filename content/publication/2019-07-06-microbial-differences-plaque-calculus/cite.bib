  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Dental calculus, calcified oral plaque biofilm,
              contains microbial and host biomolecules that can be used to
              study historic microbiome communities and host responses. Dental
              calculus does not typically accumulate as much today as
              historically, and clinical oral microbiome research studies focus
              primarily on living dental plaque biofilm. However, plaque and
              calculus reflect different conditions of the oral biofilm, and
              the differences in microbial characteristics between the sample
              types have not yet been systematically explored. Here, we compare
              the microbial profiles of modern dental plaque, modern dental
              calculus, and historic dental calculus to establish expected
              differences between these substrates. RESULTS: Metagenomic data
              was generated from modern and historic calculus samples, and
              dental plaque metagenomic data was downloaded from the Human
              Microbiome Project. Microbial composition and functional profile
              were assessed. Metaproteomic data was obtained from a subset of
              historic calculus samples. Comparisons between microbial,
              protein, and metabolomic profiles revealed distinct taxonomic and
              metabolic functional profiles between plaque, modern calculus,
              and historic calculus, but not between calculus collected from
              healthy teeth and periodontal disease-affected teeth. Species
              co-exclusion was related to biofilm environment. Proteomic
              profiling revealed that healthy tooth samples contain low levels
              of bacterial virulence proteins and a robust innate immune
              response. Correlations between proteomic and metabolomic profiles
              suggest co-preservation of bacterial lipid membranes and
              membrane-associated proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we find that
              there are systematic microbial differences between plaque and
              calculus related to biofilm physiology, and recognizing these
              differences is important for accurate data interpretation in
              studies comparing dental plaque and calculus.",
