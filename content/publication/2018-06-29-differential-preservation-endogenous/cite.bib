  abstract = "Dental calculus (calcified dental plaque) is prevalent in
              archaeological skeletal collections and is a rich source of oral
              microbiome and host-derived ancient biomolecules. Recently, it
              has been proposed that dental calculus may provide a more robust
              environment for DNA preservation than other skeletal remains, but
              this has not been systematically tested. In this study,
              shotgun-sequenced data from paired dental calculus and dentin
              samples from 48 globally distributed individuals are compared
              using a metagenomic approach. Overall, we find DNA from dental
              calculus is consistently more abundant and less contaminated than
              DNA from dentin. The majority of DNA in dental calculus is
              microbial and originates from the oral microbiome; however, a
              small but consistent proportion of DNA (mean 0.08 $\pm$ 0.08\%,
              range 0.007-0.47\%) derives from the host genome. Host DNA
              content within dentin is variable (mean 13.70 $\pm$ 18.62\%,
              range 0.003-70.14\%), and for a subset of dentin samples
              (15.21\%), oral bacteria contribute > 20\% of total DNA. Human
              DNA in dental calculus is highly fragmented, and is consistently
              shorter than both microbial DNA in dental calculus and human DNA
              in paired dentin samples. Finally, we find that microbial DNA
              fragmentation patterns are associated with guanine-cytosine (GC)
              content, but not aspects of cellular structure.",
