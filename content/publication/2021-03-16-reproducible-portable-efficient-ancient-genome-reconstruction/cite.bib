  abstract  = "The broadening utilisation of ancient DNA to address
               archaeological, palaeontological, and biological questions is
               resulting in a rising diversity in the size of laboratories and
               scale of analyses being performed. In the context of this
               heterogeneous landscape, we present an advanced, and entirely
               redesigned and extended version of the EAGER pipeline for the
               analysis of ancient genomic data. This Nextflow pipeline aims to
               address three main themes: accessibility and adaptability to
               different computing configurations, reproducibility to ensure
               robust analytical standards, and updating the pipeline to the
               latest routine ancient genomic practices. The new version of
               EAGER has been developed within the nf-core initiative to ensure
               high-quality software development and maintenance support;
               contributing to a long-term life-cycle for the pipeline.
               nf-core/eager will assist in ensuring that a wider range of
               ancient DNA analyses can be applied by a diverse range of
               research groups and fields.",
