  abstract = "Ancient DNA and RNA are valuable data sources for a wide range of
              disciplines. Within the field of ancient metagenomics, the number
              of published genetic datasets has risen dramatically in recent
              years, and tracking this data for reuse is particularly important
              for large-scale ecological and evolutionary studies of individual
              taxa and communities of both microbes and eukaryotes.
              AncientMetagenomeDir (archived at
              https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3980833 ) is a collection of
              annotated metagenomic sample lists derived from published studies
              that provide basic, standardised metadata and accession numbers
              to allow rapid data retrieval from online repositories. These
              tables are community-curated and span multiple sub-disciplines to
              ensure adequate breadth and consensus in metadata definitions, as
              well as longevity of the database. Internal guidelines and
              automated checks facilitate compatibility with established
              sequence-read archives and term-ontologies, and ensure
              consistency and interoperability for future meta-analyses. This
              collection will also assist in standardising metadata reporting
              for future ancient metagenomic studies.",
