  abstract  = "Drivers of Late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions are relevant
               to modern conservation policy in a world of growing human
               population density, climate change, and faunal decline.
               Traditional debates tend toward global solutions, blaming either
               dramatic climate change or dispersals of Homo sapiens to new
               regions. Inherent limitations to archaeological and
               paleontological data sets often require reliance on scant,
               poorly resolved lines of evidence. However, recent developments
               in scientific technologies allow for more local,
               context-specific approaches. In the present article, we
               highlight how developments in five such methodologies
               (radiocarbon approaches, stable isotope analysis, ancient DNA,
               ancient proteomics, microscopy) have helped drive detailed
               analysis of specific megafaunal species, their particular
               ecological settings, and responses to new competitors or
               predators, climate change, and other external phenomena. The
               detailed case studies of faunal community composition,
               extinction chronologies, and demographic trends enabled by these
               methods examine megafaunal extinctions at scales appropriate for
               practical understanding of threats against particular species in
               their habitats today.",
