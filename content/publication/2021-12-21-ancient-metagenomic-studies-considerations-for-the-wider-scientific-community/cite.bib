  abstract  = "Like modern metagenomics, ancient metagenomics is a highly
               data-rich discipline, with the added challenge that the DNA of
               interest is degraded and, depending on the sample type, in low
               abundance. This requires the application of specialized measures
               during molecular experiments and computational analyses.
               Furthermore, researchers often work with finite sample sizes,
               which impedes optimal experimental design and control of
               confounding factors, and with ethically sensitive samples
               necessitating the consideration of additional guidelines. In
               September 2020, early career researchers in the field of ancient
               metagenomics met (Standards, Precautions \& Advances in Ancient
               Metagenomics 2 [SPAAM2] community meeting) to discuss the state
               of the field and how to address current challenges. Here, in an
               effort to bridge the gap between ancient and modern
               metagenomics, we highlight and reflect upon some common
               misconceptions, provide a brief overview of the challenges in
               our field, and point toward useful resources for potential
               reviewers and newcomers to the field.",
