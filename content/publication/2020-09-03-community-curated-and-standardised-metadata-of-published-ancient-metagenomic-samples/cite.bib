  abstract = "Ancient DNA and RNA are valuable data sources for a wide range of
              disciplines. Within the field of ancient metagenomics, the number
              of published genetic datasets has risen dramatically in recent
              years, and tracking this data for reuse is particularly important
              for large-scale ecological and evolutionary studies of individual
              microbial taxa, microbial communities, and metagenomic
              assemblages. AncientMetagenomeDir (archived at ) is a collection
              of indices of published genetic data deriving from ancient
              microbial samples that provides basic, standardised metadata and
              accession numbers to allow rapid data retrieval from online
              repositories. These collections are community-curated and span
              multiple sub-disciplines in order to ensure adequate breadth and
              consensus in metadata definitions, as well as longevity of the
              database. Internal guidelines and automated checks to facilitate
              compatibility with established sequence-read archives and
              term-ontologies ensure consistency and interoperability for
              future meta-analyses. This collection will also assist in
              standardising metadata reporting for future ancient metagenomic
              studies. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have
