  abstract = "Dental calculus and other preserved microbiome substrates are an
              attractive target for dietary reconstruction in past populations
              through a variety of physical, chemical, and molecular means.
              Recently, studies have attempted to reconstruct diet from
              archaeological dental calculus using archaeogenetic techniques.
              While dental calculus may provide a relatively stable environment
              for DNA preservation, the detection of plants and animals
              possibly consumed by an individual through DNA analysis is
              primarily hindered by microbial richness and incomplete reference
              databases. Moreover, high genomic similarity within eukaryotic
              groups - such as mammals - can obfuscate precise taxonomic
              identification. In the current study we demonstrate the
              challenges associated with accurate taxonomic identification and
              authentication of dietary taxa in ancient DNA data using both
              synthetic and ancient dental calculus datasets. We highlight
              common errors and sources of contamination across ancient DNA
              datasets, provide recommendations for dietary DNA validation, and
              call for caution in the interpretation of diet from dental
              calculus and other archaeological microbiome substrates.",
