  abstract  = "Microbial archaeology is flourishing in the era of
               high-throughput sequencing, revealing the agents behind
               devastating historical plagues, identifying the cryptic
               movements of pathogens in prehistory, and reconstructing the
               ancestral microbiota of humans. Here, we introduce the
               fundamental concepts and theoretical framework of the
               discipline, then discuss applied methodologies for pathogen
               identification and microbiome characterization from
               archaeological samples. We give special attention to the process
               of identifying, validating, and authenticating ancient microbes
               using high-throughput DNA sequencing data. Finally, we outline
               standards and precautions to guide future research in the field.",
