  abstract  = "The oral microbiome plays key roles in human biology, health,
               and disease, but little is known about the global diversity,
               variation, or evolution of this microbial community. To better
               understand the evolution and changing ecology of the human oral
               microbiome, we analyzed 124 dental biofilm metagenomes from
               humans, including Neanderthals and Late Pleistocene to
               present-day modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, as well as
               New World howler monkeys for comparison. We find that a core
               microbiome of primarily biofilm structural taxa has been
               maintained throughout African hominid evolution, and these
               microbial groups are also shared with howler monkeys, suggesting
               that they have been important oral members since before the
               catarrhine--platyrrhine split ca. 40 Mya. However, community
               structure and individual microbial phylogenies do not closely
               reflect host relationships, and the dental biofilms of Homo and
               chimpanzees are distinguished by major taxonomic and functional
               differences. Reconstructing oral metagenomes from up to 100
               thousand years ago, we show that the microbial profiles of both
               Neanderthals and modern humans are highly similar, sharing
               functional adaptations in nutrient metabolism. These include an
               apparent Homo-specific acquisition of salivary amylase-binding
               capability by oral streptococci, suggesting microbial
               coadaptation with host diet. We additionally find evidence of
               shared genetic diversity in the oral bacteria of Neanderthal and
               Upper Paleolithic modern humans that is not observed in later
               modern human populations. Differences in the oral microbiomes of
               African hominids provide insights into human evolution, the
               ancestral state of the human microbiome, and a temporal
               framework for understanding microbial health and disease.",
